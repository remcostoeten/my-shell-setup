# Speech Recognition Script

This script converts spoken words into text using speech recognition. It listens for speech input, processes it, and copies the recognized text to the clipboard.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- speech_recognition
- pyperclip

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyperclip
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python script.py rec [nl] [sensitivity]
```

- `rec`: Required argument to start speech recognition.
- `nl`: Optional. Use this to switch to Dutch language recognition. Default is English (US).
- `sensitivity`: Optional. Adjust microphone sensitivity. Default is 1.0, lower values increase sensitivity.

Example:

```bash
python script.py rec nl 0.8
```

This will start speech recognition in Dutch with increased microphone sensitivity.

**Note:** Due to a known bug, the script may not stop listening after 5 seconds of silence as intended. To quit the script, press Enter.
