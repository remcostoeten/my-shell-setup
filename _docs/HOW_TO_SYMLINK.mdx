## How to create a symlink

To create a symlink, you can use the `ln -s` command. The first argument is the path to the file you want to symlink and the second argument is the path to the file you want to symlink it to.

```bash
ln -s ~/path/to/the/file/you/want/to/symlink/to/filename.sh ~/.path/to/the/file/you/want/to/symlink/from/filename.sh
```

Which will create a symlink from `~/.path/to/the/file/you/want/to/symlink/from/filename.sh` to `~/path/to/the/file/you/want/to/symlink/to/filename.sh`.

Example:

```bash
ln -s ~/.config/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

This will create a symlink from `~/.zshrc` to `~/.config/dotfiles/.zshrc`.
